## Bayesian Data Analysis
- By Bayesian data analysis, we mean practical methods for making inferences from data using probability models for quantities we observe and about which we wish to learn

- The essential characteristic of Bayesian methods is their __explicit use of probability for quantifying uncertainty_ in inferences based on statistical analysis

- from Gelman et al. __Bayesian Data Analysis__ 3rd edition 2013

## Outline {.smaller}

### Day 1
* __Brief introduction to Bayesian Inference__
* __Hierarchical Modeling__
    * examples in BUGS/JAGS/STAN
* __Bayesian meta-analysis__
* __Introduction to MCMC__

### Day 2

* __Predictive distribution model checking__
    * missing values handling
* __Bayesian Disease Mapping__
* __Prior calibration__

Many examples in BUGS/STAN/JAGS are provided along with the scripts for the practicals

## Pre-requisites {.smaller}
* There are no formal pre-requisites
* Analysis will be performed in the R programming language: [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)
* Rstudio [http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is recommended
* The following R packages will be used in class:
    + RStan
    + rstanarm
    + R2OpenBUGS
    + BRugs
    + rjags
    + 
   
* Download and install:
    + Stan [http://mc-stan.org/](http://mc-stan.org/)
        + make sure to follow all the instruction and setup correctly the toolchain
    + OpenBUGS [http://www.openbugs.net/w/FrontPage](http://www.openbugs.net/w/FrontPage) 
    + JAGS [http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)

## Getting the slides

* The slides for this course were created with Rmarkdown: [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). 
* They are available from [https://github.com/berkeley3/BDA](https://github.com/berkeley3/BDA).
* To re-compile the slides:

    + Download the directory containing the lectures from Github
    + In R open the .Rmd file and set the working directory to the lecture directory
    + Click the *KnitHTML* button on Rstudio or run the following commands: 
  
```{r RmarkdownChunk, eval=FALSE}
library(rmarkdown) 
render("main.Rmd")
```
